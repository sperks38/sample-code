The name of the repository says it all.

The files in this repository do not necessarily go together. They are intended to show snippets of
the use of HTML, css and JavaScript.

One exception to that is the partnership between branding.css.less and subtheme-vars.css.less.
subtheme-vars.css.less simply sets the branding colors, header treatments etc to be utilized by
branding.css.less which sits on the main theme. This allows us to add/edit css to branding.css.less
and affect all our sites in one change.
